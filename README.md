# Case-Study-e-commerce-
This is a case study project for my internship. It includes Product dissection, revenue growth strategies and guesstimates for an e-commerce website


The Part I of document(.docx) provided above is the case study for an e-commerce platform in which the complete product has been dissected along with its
features, impacts, realworld problems and how those problems were solved by the platform. A hypothetical database schema was also designed and 
has been presented in the document as well which would have supported the operational growth of the respective e-commerce platform.
Then, certain challenges have also been mentioned which the platform is facing presently and some strategies have also been presented which will help
the platform overcome those challenges and improve its revenue and profit growth by 25% in 1 year.

In the Part II of the project, some pretty common interview guesstimates questions have been answered.

Thanks for checking this out.
I'm open for suggestions
Thanks again
