The Part I of document(.docx) provided above is the case study for an e-commerce platform in which the complete product has been dissected along with its
features, impacts, realworld problems and how those problems were solved by the platform. A hypothetical database schema was also designed and 
has been presented in the document as well which would have supported the operational growth of the respective e-commerce platform.
Then, certain challenges have also been mentioned which the platform is facing presently and some strategies have also been presented which will help
the platform overcome those challenges and improve its revenue and profit growth by 25% in 1 year.
